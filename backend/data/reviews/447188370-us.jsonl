It was the best app to exist for the longest time. After a while, I decided to delete it and didn‚Äôt download it back for over a year. Today, I decided to get it back. A lot has changed. First of all suddenly you need to pay for your memories? And then, the watermarks. Can it get any worse? Apparently it can. I decide to go change my username because I don‚Äôt like my current one. I try it and then it asks for my password, which I forgot. So, I go to put in and verify my email, but then it gives an error. I try it again two or three times and it kicks me out onto the LOG IN screen. Now I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúweird..‚Äù I try to log in and since I don‚Äôt remember my password and don‚Äôt have my email linked to my account, I use my phone number. Once I write it down, it tells me that my account was locked for apparently violating the community guidelines. So now I get more mad and go check it out in the Help Centre. Apparently now my account is permanently locked AND I can‚Äôt make an appeal. Oh, and Help Centre and Support are NO help. Now I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúgreat, this was the worst it could get.‚Äù But no, I was wrong. I get mad and try my number a couple of times and it decides to say that I tried too many times and that I should try later. I‚Äôm like, okay ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait.‚Äù Tell me why my friend texts me, saying that my account isn‚Äôt anywhere. She searched in her friends, she searched in quick add. My account is nowhere. So I go to log in again, and when I write down my username, guess what it says. Of course, it says that the username I wrote down isn‚Äôt linked to any account. So now not only Snapchat wants money for you to keep memories, it adds watermarks to things you save, AND also DELETES your account with ALL your memories and friends WITHOUT your permission? I‚Äôm honestly so so so disappointed and unless my account can be magically revived, I‚Äôm not using this stupid app again. I hope they know they‚Äôre gonna keep losing users like me if they keep this up.","submittedAt":"2025-10-13T07:27:21Z"}

Snapchat also only lets you text other people when they except the invite to talk to you, so that another good benefit if your 11 or younger which I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for you younger then 11 but it‚Äôs not my choice so go ahead and have an amazing time on this fun app with fun filters.","submittedAt":"2025-10-12T15:47:46Z"}

You‚Äôre not Tik Tok, why do you have reels? \nYou have filters \u0026 dancing figures! \nYou have streaks!\nYou have bitmojis \u0026 stickers! \nYou have snap glasses that record! \nYou have exclusivity that is available to everyone. \nYou allow a freedom of expression within your app that is protected by vanishing posts, texts, \u0026 pictures THAT NO ONE ELSE OFFERS \nand you‚Äôre ruining it for greed. \nYou‚Äôre ruining throwing away your success and will become like KiK \u0026 MySpace. PLEASE DON‚ÄôT PUSH THE MASSES AWAY. We adore \u0026 value what you bring to our lives. \nBeen with Snapchat since 2014, I truly miss the simplicity of it, my favorite Snapchat was when memories first launched. I remember when bitmojis first arrived, not only on Facebook anymore! I recall when you guys first introduced the articles \u0026 medias within the app. \nGrowing so much has become a burden and has taken away from the joy of using your platform. \nWe miss what once was. \nIt grew successful because people love it, now it‚Äôs overstimulating for most because people no longer simply snap \u0026 chat anymore. You have done too much \u0026 taken it away from us. \n\n\nA simple proposal :   Offer a free version of snap that is older, example the 2018 versions, meanwhile offering the current snap with a subscription. \n\nCustomer satisfaction is the life-line of any company due to CUSTOMERS BRINGING MONEY. There are other ways to make money \u0026 keep your business thriving.","submittedAt":"2025-10-10T18:01:31Z"}

Why do we now have to pay for a subscription in order to access them? Not everyone has the financial ability to pay, especially with the current circumstances.\n\nWe rely on Snapchat to save our photos because of its accuracy and reliability. Many of our memories are stored within the app, and 5MB of storage is simply not enough. We kindly ask you to reconsider this update so we can continue using Snapchat the way we love. Our memories are very important to us, and we value them deeply through your platform.\n\nWe hope that you will remove or adjust this update to allow all users to access their memories freely. Forcing users to pay in order to view what is already theirs feels unfair and greedy.\n\nOnce again, we sincerely ask you to reconsider this matter.","submittedAt":"2025-10-14T17:06:08Z"}

Saved on Snapchat are of my grandma, great grandma, brother, cousin and multiple best friends who have all passed. From cancer all the way to car crashes. My favorite thing about Snapchat was the ability to look back in these memories. Memories ive saved from the 6th grade and up. I looked forward to being able to show my future children how my life was back in the day when they came to the appropriate age. But now Snapchat is taking all that way. They are Turku being greedy. I understand having a membership but now charging us to even SAVE pictures or keep the pictures we had saved before all this came out is downright wrong. This is truly the fall of Snapchat.","submittedAt":"2025-10-14T05:17:18Z"}

Don‚Äôt forget, that us longtime users are the reason Snapchat is so successful, and the reason its popularity has increased over the past few years.

Where my complaint lies is the exporting options we have. Info and instructions on this are extremely vague, so let me just clue you all in to how awful the exporting process is if you have as many Snapchat memories as I do. Each image downloaded on my computer from the export is a literal file (not technically an image) and I can only view what the image is if I open it on a web browser. Each video is an HEVC file and can‚Äôt be played on my computer without purchasing a video extension on the Microsoft store. How on earth am I supposed to go back and look through these in the future without being able to see any previews for anything? I‚Äôm going to have to pay money just to watch the videos and I will have to scroll through and periodically open images through a web browser to find a timeline or find something specific. I am less mad about having to pay for memory storage than I am about how the only options for exporting all of them are so inconvenient. I have been using Snapchat since 2016 and I have 9 years worth of videos and images I need to save (the file told me the total number was about 87k pics and vids) and not a single one is viewable in my files without external sources. That is actually insane. I have been a consistent and loyal Snapchat user for almost a decade and I cannot fathom how inconvenient they have made this process. Thank you Snapchat.","submittedAt":"2025-10-16T03:51:37Z"}
