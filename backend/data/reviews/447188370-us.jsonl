It was the best app to exist for the longest time. After a while, I decided to delete it and didn‚Äôt download it back for over a year. Today, I decided to get it back. A lot has changed. First of all suddenly you need to pay for your memories? And then, the watermarks. Can it get any worse? Apparently it can. I decide to go change my username because I don‚Äôt like my current one. I try it and then it asks for my password, which I forgot. So, I go to put in and verify my email, but then it gives an error. I try it again two or three times and it kicks me out onto the LOG IN screen. Now I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúweird..‚Äù I try to log in and since I don‚Äôt remember my password and don‚Äôt have my email linked to my account, I use my phone number. Once I write it down, it tells me that my account was locked for apparently violating the community guidelines. So now I get more mad and go check it out in the Help Centre. Apparently now my account is permanently locked AND I can‚Äôt make an appeal. Oh, and Help Centre and Support are NO help. Now I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúgreat, this was the worst it could get.‚Äù But no, I was wrong. I get mad and try my number a couple of times and it decides to say that I tried too many times and that I should try later. I‚Äôm like, okay ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait.‚Äù Tell me why my friend texts me, saying that my account isn‚Äôt anywhere. She searched in her friends, she searched in quick add. My account is nowhere. So I go to log in again, and when I write down my username, guess what it says. Of course, it says that the username I wrote down isn‚Äôt linked to any account. So now not only Snapchat wants money for you to keep memories, it adds watermarks to things you save, AND also DELETES your account with ALL your memories and friends WITHOUT your permission? I‚Äôm honestly so so so disappointed and unless my account can be magically revived, I‚Äôm not using this stupid app again. I hope they know they‚Äôre gonna keep losing users like me if they keep this up.","submittedAt":"2025-10-13T07:27:21Z"}

Snapchat also only lets you text other people when they except the invite to talk to you, so that another good benefit if your 11 or younger which I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for you younger then 11 but it‚Äôs not my choice so go ahead and have an amazing time on this fun app with fun filters.","submittedAt":"2025-10-12T15:47:46Z"}

I have had snap for 11 years. \nSnap you have to remember who you are! What you bring to the media platforms, \nYou‚Äôre not instagram, posts last 24. You‚Äôre not Tik Tok, why do you have reels? \nYou have filters \u0026 dancing figures! \nYou have streaks!\nYou have bitmojis \u0026 stickers! \nYou have snap glasses that record! \nYou have exclusivity that is available to everyone. \nYou allow a freedom of expression within your app that is protected by vanishing posts, texts, \u0026 pictures THAT NO ONE ELSE OFFERS \nand you‚Äôre ruining it for greed. \nYou‚Äôre ruining throwing away your success and will become like KiK \u0026 MySpace. PLEASE DON‚ÄôT PUSH THE MASSES AWAY. We adore \u0026 value what you bring to our lives. \nBeen with Snapchat since 2014, I truly miss the simplicity of it, my favorite Snapchat was when memories first launched. I remember when bitmojis first arrived, not only on Facebook anymore! I recall when you guys first introduced the articles \u0026 medias within the app. \nGrowing so much has become a burden and has taken away from the joy of using your platform. \nWe miss what once was. \nIt grew successful because people love it, now it‚Äôs overstimulating for most because people no longer simply snap \u0026 chat anymore. You have done too much \u0026 taken it away from us. \n\n\nA simple proposal :   Offer a free version of snap that is older, example the 2018 versions, meanwhile offering the current snap with a subscription. \n\nCustomer satisfaction is the life-line of any company due to CUSTOMERS BRINGING MONEY. There are other ways to make money \u0026 keep your business thriving.","submittedAt":"2025-10-10T18:01:31Z"}
