However this app is terrible at itemizing items. I used a very clear photo of my receipt- the app included the “subtotal”, “tax”, and “total” amounts as line items that I then had to manually delete. Then, the app added a 58 dollar tip and I have no idea where they came from even after investigating my receipt. A 20% tip on our bill (which we left) was only ~20 dollars. \n\nThis app also does not let you edit the dollar amount of tax charged (in my case the app put it down as 0, which isn’t correct), which seems like a massive oversight. You should at least have the option to manually enter the amount of percentage of tax charged considering how bad the app is at itemizing. \n\nI am giving two stars, simply because the app DID itemize the actual items on my receipt correctly, with correct dollar amount and (close enough) names. With some manual override, I was about to get the bill within ~10 dollars of the actual amount paid - so in the end it can still be useful. This app has a lot of potential, it just needs a better algorithm at itemizing, and a manual override feature for the amount of tax paid.","submittedAt":"2024-06-15T10:49:14Z"}

This app has likely saved me money (of me missing a few dollars/cents trying to figure out this math on my own) and so many headaches splitting bills of large groups at restaurants that do not want to take the time to do separate checks. \n\nOver time, I have actually found it easier to just use this app rather than asking the server to do separate checks. In my experience with Tab, if you’re willing to do the work of figuring out who got what yourself, your servers get the order right, your food comes quicker (since they don’t have to spend a long time at the computer typing everything in carefully), and it makes the experience for the group better as a whole. \n\nA few feature suggestions:\n\nAppetizers: A conversation that tends to come up when deciding who got what is “well this person are more of this than this person.” Can you create a way to say “this person had 4 of 12 items from this” instead of splitting it 12 ways and tapping it four times? Technically the app does this, but it requires a bit of extra taps. \n\nAlcohol: Guests may feel it’s appropriate to tip more for elaborate cocktails than they would for a pizza. Servers also tip out the bartender. Is there a way to figure out how to skew tips up based on how much of the bill was alcohol? For example, 15% for the food, 20% for the alcohol.","submittedAt":"2023-09-25T04:42:04Z"}

Tab was the only one I’ve found and it looked very promising. \nUnfortunately for my specific use case it didn’t work out well, but I still believe it’s a great app. \n\nA few notes for devs, hope this could be useful:\n\n- Since my checks are in foreign language I have to translate these using Google Translate and save image of translated receipts. Luckily Tab can use receipt image! Unfortunately it’s OCR capability seems to be limited, it can’t handle these translated receipts well, even text actually look nice and sharp. Probably just need better OCR library. \n- Somewhere closer to final step it tells me that $23 is not distributed. I expect a shortcut here to let me quickly fix this. It’s not here. Also on a step where items are marked it could do better job showing issues like not assigned items. \n- Not all receipts are in USD, people in other countries use other currencies 😏","submittedAt":"2023-03-25T12:42:47Z"}

When I click “Connect Venmo” all I see is a blank screen with 2 empty circles, and clicking “Allow” does not do anything. After awhile I’ll then get a prompt that says “We were unable to connect your Venmo account, please try again”. \n\nThis app is such a great idea, and I would love to come back and update this review to be 5 stars if the developer could reply \u0026 comment with how to get the Venmo integration to work.","submittedAt":"2022-05-23T14:08:22Z"}

Seems like such a stupid limitation in a modern app\n- The bills OFTEN aren't parsed correctly requiring a lot of manual effort to correct each item, take a really long time to parse or on occasion simply error out\n- There's a really bad bug when you need to edit the name or amount of an item and instead of letting you put the cursor in the middle to fix 1 letter, it'll put the cursor at the end so you have to erase the whole title and retype it\n- You can't export the original receipt image or the final breakdown anywhere\n- The app needs full camera flash when taking pictures EVERY TIME\n- There's no way to breakdown amounts unevenly.

Most of the group is technically challenged (seniors) so have no clue how to use an app or do not want to so I get stuck with figuring out the check. It would be helpful if;\n\n1. I could identify the group before I get the check,\n\n2. Be able to see a snapshot of the details for one person  at a time after I identify what they had as part of the totals so I could show them and \n\n3. Allow cents when entering a tip (sometimes when using a credit card we add a tip amount that would round the total)\n\n4. For me the most important one would be to be able somehow to show all the details of the bill when emailing it or texting it or printing it.

Deleting the included tips should automatically add this misinterpreted item to the list, but it doesn't. It has to be entered manually. \nI'd like to see the tax displayed as a percentage as well.

We had a weird tax on the bill last night and it took us a while to figure out how to edit it. There were 2 “sub” taxes listed and a total and the app added all 3 in.\n\n3. It’s hard to label the bill. You have to go back in and hit it from a weird screen. \n\n4. I love that I can text the breakdown of the costs to my friends, but like the layout and info of the breakdown in the app. Might be nice if you could text the image of the breakdown by person, instead of the whole thing, or for it to make a pdf of the breakdown that I could text to everyone! \n\nAll in all the app is great and with weird situations the app usually has a response, it’s just hard to figure it out when that happens. We all love it. Most useful app I own by far!!!!","submittedAt":"2020-01-11T17:22:54Z"}

Bills are now DELETED once you leave the app, unless you sign up for a totally unnecessary account with them. The app still has the technical ability to save bills locally of course, and iCloud can sync and backup app data, but they have to find some leverage to get us to give them our email addresses so they can sell them or monetize us somehow.\n\nI’m at least accustomed to that kind of selling-out by app developers at this point. But what I cannot abide is lacking the common decency to TELL your users what you’re doing.

Other than that, this app is exactly what I’ve been needing!  I will use this all the time now. At large dinners it was always a hassle to split bills and people would get charged equally for tip and tax but always felt it was unfair to get charged the same tip and tax rate when they got a cheaper meal - so this app solves that problem for me!","submittedAt":"2018-03-02T05:54:57Z"}

I had a question come up later but could not get back to the details to verify that we had split the bill correctly, adding some audit trail would be really useful in this situation. Additionally, another great feature would be to be able to send out, via text or email, an itemized receipt to each of the bill participants. The people I regularly split large bills with have a wide range of comfort with technology, it would be nice to be able to send them something more detailed than just their totals but show them the items selected and their portion of taxes and tip. Asking them to join the bill from their device is way beyond what they would be willing to do. With these two enhancements, this would be the perfect app for my needs.","submittedAt":"2018-02-27T19:42:27Z"}

Great concept but not accurate. The tax was also double the amount of the bill?? Our bill was like $240 and tax came out as $230 and I wasn’t able to edit it. So everyone abandoned the AP and resorted back to traditional methods to sort out the bill... bummer! Was a brilliant concept!","submittedAt":"2018-02-26T03:33:54Z"}
